Hardware Title

Weather Cuckoo Clock

Description
——————————-
The product is implemented using an Arduino Yún and an Arduino UNO microcontroller boards. The different birds and the temperature are set by rotation of stepper motors attached to the yun. The birds are pushed through the windows using a servo motor. The city selection is done by a potentiometer connected to the yun. The uno has a stepper attached to a rotary encoder connected to it for the chain to predict the weather and rotate back to default position. The motors are operated using a adafruit motor shield (v2.0) attached to the yun and the uno.
